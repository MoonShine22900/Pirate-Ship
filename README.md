# Pirate-Ship
"Pirate Ship" is a program for MacOS in development made in python that allows you to execute terminal commands commonly used in software cracking.
The project does not support piracy, but these commands are useful for third-party applications and more.

The program is still in development, remember, piracy is illegal. don't do it ðŸ˜‰.

Do you want to collaborate in the development? PERFECT, just edit the MODIFICATIONS script, put your name, in the case of small changes just put what was changed, and what line of code it goes on (it can be several elements), or in the case of A TOTAL CHANGE WRITES all the code, to simplify my life.
