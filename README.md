# End of the project
Unfortunately, despite being launched just a day ago, the project is being misused for hacking purposes instead of its intended purpose, which was to provide a trial version of pirated software. Due to this misuse, I have decided to discontinue the project.

The pirate ship is now CLOSED.

There will be no further official support for this project. However, please note that my program is licensed under GPLv3, so you are free to fork and modify it under the same terms.

We want to remind you that using and installing pirated software is illegal. We strongly discourage any form of piracy. If you find software valuable, please support its creators by purchasing a legitimate copy. Piracy not only hurts developers but also compromises your system's security.

However, if you still decide to use pirated software, consider making donations to the developers or contributing in other ways. Remember, while piracy is illegal and wrong, it is especially unethical if you are generating profits from the pirated software or if you have the means to pay for it.

The primary purpose of this program was to allow you to download and try software that might have limited trial versions. If you find the software useful, please purchase it to support the developers. If you do not like it, please delete it.

Supporting legal software ensures continued development and innovation. If you are unable to afford the software, consider looking for free or open-source alternatives. Letâ€™s support the hardworking developers who bring valuable tools and applications to the world.

Please note that I am not responsible if you encounter viruses or other security issues as a result of using pirated software.

SORRY COMPANIES I MADE YOU LOSE A LITTLE MONEY :(
